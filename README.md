# Pi4_LV5048_Dashboard

Simple Flask Dashboard that uses the api for the MPP Solar LV 5048 inverter to query the status of the inverter and save the data to a local sqlite database.  The application is also accompanied by a scheduled task not included which intermittently queries the inverter and saves the data to the database for trend analysis.

NOTE: the api is not included and can be found here.
